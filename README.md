Basic Vulnerability Scanner
Overview
This is a basic vulnerability scanner implemented in Python. It scans a specified IP address for open ports and checks for common vulnerabilities associated with those ports.

Features
Scans an IP address for open ports.
Checks for common vulnerabilities related to those ports.
Provides a basic report of open ports and potential vulnerabilities.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
python-nmap library
Installation
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
Install Dependencies

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the Scanner

Execute the scanner.py script:

bash
Copy code
python scanner.py
Provide Inputs

Enter the target IP address you want to scan.
Enter the port range (e.g., 1-65535) for scanning.
Review Results

The script will display open ports and potential vulnerabilities associated with those ports.

Example
vbnet
Copy code
Enter the target IP address: 192.168.1.1
Enter the port range (e.g., 1-65535): 1-100
Scanning IP: 192.168.1.1 on ports 1-100...
Open ports: [22, 80, 443]
Potential vulnerabilities:
- Port 22 (SSH) might be vulnerable to Brute Force attacks.
- Port 80 (HTTP) might be vulnerable to common web exploits.
- Port 443 (HTTPS) might be vulnerable to outdated SSL/TLS configurations.
Notes
Authorization: Ensure you have permission to scan the IP address you are testing. Unauthorized scanning can be considered intrusive and illegal.
Improvements: This is a basic scanner. For more advanced features, consider adding:
Integration with vulnerability databases.
Support for scanning multiple IP addresses.
A graphical user interface (GUI).
